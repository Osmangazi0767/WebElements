The professional setting allows for immediate monitoring of patients, which is crucial in cases of severe asthma attacks.</p> <p>Hospital pharmacies benefit from a highly regulated environment, ensuring that asthma medicines are dispensed safely under medical supervision. As asthma-related emergencies can often result in hospitalization, hospitals serve as the frontline in managing critical cases. The growth in hospital pharmacy services for asthma treatment is supported by technological advancements in healthcare, such as the development of nebulizers and other delivery devices that provide effective drug administration. As the population ages and the prevalence of asthma increases, the need for quick-acting asthma medicines within hospitals is likely to rise.</p> <h2>2.
