Many SMEs in the liquid collagen space focus on innovation, using their smaller size and flexibility to develop cutting-edge products that resonate with health-conscious consumers. For example, SMEs are likely to experiment with unique delivery formats such as collagen-infused snacks, supplements, or skincare products, which can appeal to specific consumer needs.

Another significant trend is the rise of beauty-from-within products, with liquid collagen supplements positioned as a vital component of a comprehensive skincare routine.
