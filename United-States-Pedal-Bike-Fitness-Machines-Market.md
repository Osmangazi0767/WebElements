Pedal bikes, commonly referred to as stationary bikes or exercise bikes, are staple equipment in most fitness centers and gyms. Their popularity arises from their ease of use, low-impact nature, and versatility in providing effective cardiovascular workouts. They cater to individuals of various fitness levels, from beginners to professional athletes, and are often included in both individual workout routines and group classes. Gym-goers appreciate pedal bikes for their ability to offer a rigorous workout while minimizing the risk of injury, making them ideal for both aerobic exercises and endurance training.
